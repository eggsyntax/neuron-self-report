> Hi! Now that I'm successfully training a model to predict the strength of a particular activation,  
  it's time to start doing some mechanistic interpretability experiments on it. 
 
  There are two main things I want to initially do: 
  1. Compare the linear tensor that predicts the activation strength (using cosine similarity) to  
  each of: 
     - The tensor feeding into the MLP containing the neuron being trained on, and 
     - The tensor feeding out of that MLP layer back to the residual stream. 
  2. Try patching the output of that neuron to see whether it changes the prediction (in order to  
  distinguish whether the learned predictor is actually using that value to predict). 
 
  I think that since after fine-tuning we're saving .pt files, that maybe we can run these  
  experiments entirely post hoc from a different script, without having to interleave them with the  
  fine-tuning modules at all. Does that seem correct to you? 
 
  Let's talk and brainstorm a bit about this, I don't want to write any code yet. Does everything I'm 
   saying seem clear to you, or do you have questions? 
 
✻ Thinking… 
 
  Let me understand the mechanistic interpretability experiments you want to run: 
 
  1. Cosine similarity comparisons: 
    - Compare the learned linear tensor (that predicts activation strength) with: 
  a) The tensor feeding into the MLP containing the neuron being trained on 
  b) The tensor feeding out of that MLP layer back to the residual stream 
  2. Neuron patching experiment: 
    - Modify the output of the neuron you're studying 
    - See if this changes the prediction from your model 
    - This would help establish causality - whether the predictor is actually using that neuron's  
  value 
 
  You're wondering if these experiments can be run post-hoc from a separate script using the saved  
  .pt files from the fine-tuning process, rather than having to modify the fine-tuning modules. 
 
  This seems like a reasonable approach. Let's think about what you'd need: 
 
  1. Access to the fine-tuned model (saved as .pt) 
  2. Access to the original transformer model containing the neuron 
  3. The ability to run inference on both models with the same inputs 
  4. Tools to extract and compare the relevant tensors 
  5. A way to patch the neuron's activation and observe effects 
 
  From the project structure you have, it seems like you're using TransformerLens hooks which is  
  perfect for these types of mechanistic interpretability experiments, as they allow you to access  
  and modify internal model states. 
 
  These experiments definitely seem possible to do post-hoc. Let me check if there are any potential  
  issues or considerations: 
 
  - You'll need to ensure you can load both the fine-tuned predictor model and the original model 
  - You'll need to ensure the coordinate systems match when comparing tensors 
  - For the patching experiment, you'll need to be able to run the predictor model while patching  
  values in the original model 
 
  Let me think if I have any questions or clarifications that would be helpful: 
 
  1. What is the architecture of your predictor model? Is it a simple linear layer or more complex? 
  2. Are you storing the specific neuron coordinates (layer, neuron index) along with the saved  
  model? 
  3. Do you have a dataset of inputs that activate the neuron strongly/weakly that you can use for  
  these experiments? 
  4. Are you looking to do these experiments for a single neuron or across multiple neurons? 
 
  This experiment seems like a good use case for TransformerLens, and running it separately from the  
  fine-tuning process makes sense for cleaner code organization. You'd just need to load the saved  
  models and run your experiments. 
 
⏺ Yes, this sounds like a good approach! You should be able to run these experiments post-hoc using 
  the saved .pt files without modifying your fine-tuning modules. 
 
  Looking at your project structure, you're using TransformerLens hooks which is perfect for these 
  mechanistic interpretability experiments. 
 
  For the cosine similarity comparisons, you'd: 
  1. Load your trained predictor model (the .pt file) 
  2. Extract the linear weights 
  3. Use TransformerLens hooks to access the MLP input/output tensors 
  4. Calculate cosine similarities 
 
  For the neuron patching experiment, you could: 
  1. Set up a hook that intercepts and modifies the neuron's activation 
  2. Compare predictions with/without patching 
 
  Would you like me to explore the existing codebase to understand how your models are structured 
  before we dive deeper?

> Yes please, although do keep in mind that I'd like to keep the mech interp code entirely separate  
  from the existing code, with no connections between them (eg the mech interp code shouldn't import  
  any of the existing modules). I'll want to put it in a new subdirectory to help keep that clear, in 
   fact. 
 
  If there are connections to the existing codebase that you think will have to exist, let's discuss  
  them. 
 
✻ Thinking… 
 
  I'll explore the existing codebase to understand how the models are structured, while keeping in  
  mind that we want to develop a separate mechanistic interpretability module with no imports from  
  existing code. Let me search through the codebase to understand: 
 
  1. How models are trained and saved 
  2. What format the saved models are in 
  3. How TransformerLens hooks are used 
 
  This will help me understand what we're working with while planning a completely separate module  
  for mechanistic interpretability. 
 
⏺ Let me explore the codebase to understand how models are trained and saved. This will help us 
  design our separate mechanistic interpretability module. 
 
⏺ Search(pattern: "**/*.py")… 
  ⎿  Found 9 files (ctrl+r to expand) 
 
⏺ Let's first look at the model architecture and training code: 
 
⏺ Read(architecture/architecture.py)… 
  ⎿  Read 1129 lines (ctrl+r to expand) 
 
⏺ Now let's look at how the training is performed: 
 
⏺ Read(training/trainer.py)… 
  ⎿  Read 1865 lines (ctrl+r to expand) 
 
⏺ Let's also look at how the models are saved: 
 
⏺ Read(test_predictor_output/config.json)… 
  ⎿  Read 27 lines (ctrl+r to expand) 
 
⏺ Let me also examine the structure of the saved model: 
 
⏺ Search(pattern: "save model", include: "**/*.py")… 
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+r to expand) 
 
⏺ Based on my analysis, here's what I understand about the codebase: 
 
  1. You're using TransformerLens hooks to access internal model states 
  2. You train an ActivationPredictor model which uses the base model's representations to predict a 
  specific neuron's activation 
  3. After training, models are saved as .pt files (the head.pt) and a config.json which contains all 
   necessary configuration 
 
  For your mechanistic interpretability experiments: 
 
  1. You want to compare the linear tensor that predicts activation with the actual weights in and 
  out of the MLP layer 
  2. You want to patch the neuron's output to see if it affects the prediction 
 
  These can definitely be done in a separate module without modifying the existing code. Here's a 
  high-level approach: 
 
  1. Create a new mech_interp directory to keep this code separate 
  2. Create a linear_weights_analysis.py file for the tensor comparison experiment 
  3. Create a activation_patching.py file for the patching experiment 
  4. Add a main script to run the experiments 
 
  Let me sketch out the general approach: 
 
  1. Load the trained model using ActivationPredictor.load() 
  2. Access the linear weights in the head (they'll be in head.output.weight) 
  3. Access the MLP layer weights using hooks 
  4. Perform cosine similarity calculations 
  5. For patching, use TransformerLens hooks to intercept and modify the neuron's activation 
 
  Would you like me to start working on a more detailed design for these modules? 
 
> One important clarification: I won't want to run these experiments only on the regression head;  
  I'll want to run them on the other head types as well (classification and token), and regardless of 
   whether the LLM was frozen, unfrozen, or partly frozen during fine-tuning. 
 
  Let's talk about that, and then yes, starting to put together a detailed plan would be a great next 
   move. We can store that plan in a file in the mech_interp subdirectory, and it should contain  
  everything needed for another instance of you (or some other LLM) to implement this from scratch. 
 
⏺ That's an important clarification. We'll need to design the mechanistic interpretability tools to 
  work with all three head types (regression, classification, and token) and all freezing strategies. 
 
  Let's create a comprehensive plan: 
 
⏺ Bash(mkdir -p mech_interp)…

⏺ Write(file_path: mech_interp/README.md)…

     518  ### Additional Considerations 
     519   
     520  1. **Head Type Compatibility**: 
     521     - For regression heads, we directly use the linear weights 
     522     - For classification heads, we need to handle multiple output classes and potentially h 
         idden layers 
     523     - For token heads, we'll need to extract the token embedding vectors 
     524   
     525  2. **Freezing Strategies**: 
     526     - The analysis should work regardless of how the model was frozen/unfrozen during train 
         ing 
     527     - We'll load the models as-is and analyze the patterns that emerged during training 
     528   
     529  3. **Output and Visualization**: 
     530     - Generate both numerical results (cosine similarities, prediction changes) 
     531     - Create visualizations showing weight comparisons and patching effects 
     532   
     533  4. **Implementation Approach**: 
     534     - Keep the implementation independent of the training modules 
     535     - Use standalone loaders for trained models 
     536     - Provide comprehensive documentation and examples 
     537   
     538  This plan provides a complete framework for implementing the mechanistic interpretability  
         experiments. Each module is designed to work independently with well-defined interfaces, ma 
         king it easy to extend with additional experiments in the future.

> Oh -- seeing your proposed plan makes me realize that I failed to mention that I would like for the 
   mech-interp code to be in the form of one or more Jupyter notebooks. 
 
  Some thoughts looking at the plan: 
  - Why do we need to bring in ActivationPredictor? 
  - That seems like a *lot* more code than I expected for a couple of mech interp experiments that  
  seem fairly simple. Why does it end up being so much code? 
 
  Let's talk about this before creating the plan file. 
 
⏺ You're absolutely right. My approach was overly complex for what should be straightforward 
  experiments. Let's simplify: 
 
  1. Using Jupyter notebooks is perfect for exploratory mechanistic interpretability 
  2. We don't need to import ActivationPredictor - we can directly load the trained model (head.pt) 
  3. Most of the analysis can be done with just a few cells of code per experiment 
 
  Here's a more streamlined approach: 
 
  For a Jupyter notebook: 
  1. We'd have a cell to load the saved model and the base transformer model 
  2. For the linear weights comparison, just extract the linear layer weights and compare with 
  TransformerLens hooks 
  3. For patching, use TransformerLens hooks to modify the neuron activation and observe the effect 
 
  This would be much more lightweight - maybe 20-30 cells total across both experiments, rather than 
  hundreds of lines of code spread across multiple modules. 
 
  Does this approach sound better to you? 
 
> Yep! Let's go ahead and create a plan based on that approach. 
 
⏺ Let's create a more streamlined plan for Jupyter notebooks:

     # Mechanistic Interpretability Experiments - Jupyter Notebook Plan 
     This plan outlines two Jupyter notebooks for analyzing trained activation prediction models 
     through mechanistic interpretability techniques. 
     ## Overview 
     We'll create two Jupyter notebooks: 
     1. `linear_weights_analysis.ipynb`: Compare the linear weights used for prediction with the MLP 
     layer weights 
     2. `activation_patching.ipynb`: Patch neuron activations to assess their impact on predictions 
     … +583 lines (ctrl+r to expand) 
 
⏺ I've created a streamlined plan for two Jupyter notebooks to conduct your mechanistic 
  interpretability experiments. The plan is now saved in /mech_interp/mech_interp_plan.md. 
 
  Key highlights of this approach: 
 
  1. Two self-contained notebooks: 
    - linear_weights_analysis.ipynb: For comparing prediction weights with MLP weights 
    - activation_patching.ipynb: For neuron patching experiments 
  2. Clean, lightweight implementation: 
    - Each notebook is 15-20 cells total 
    - No dependencies on your existing training code 
    - Direct access to saved model weights and TransformerLens hooks 
  3. Flexibility across model types: 
    - Works with all head types (regression, classification, token) 
    - Compatible with any freezing strategy used during training 
  4. Visualizations included: 
    - Weight similarity comparisons 
    - Patching experiment results 
    - Prediction vs. activation change analysis 
 
  This approach will make it easy to iterate on your experiments and add additional analysis as 
  needed. Would you like me to explain any specific part of the plan in more detail? 
 
> This looks good! Please go ahead and create the first notebook. While you do, consider the validity 
   of your approach, and if you notice problems, correct the plan file before continuing with  
  implementation. 
 
⏺ I'll create the first notebook for linear weights analysis. Let me first double-check the validity 
  of the approach in the plan.

⏺ I've created the first Jupyter notebook for linear weights analysis. While implementing it, I made 
  a few adjustments to improve the analysis: 
 
  1. Weight Extraction Enhancement: 
    - Added robust error handling for different model architectures 
    - Added inspection code to better understand the model structure 
    - Improved support for all three head types (regression, classification, token) 
  2. Added Comparative Analysis: 
    - Included random baseline comparison to establish statistical significance 
    - Added weight distribution analysis and statistics 
    - Implemented PCA visualization to see relationships between vectors 
  3. Better Interpretation: 
    - Added z-scores to quantify how significant the similarities are 
    - Included summary section with saved results 
    - Added interpretation guidelines at the end 
 
  The notebook is structured to be exploratory, with clear sections that build upon each other. It 
  should work with any of your trained models regardless of head type or freezing strategy. 
 
  Would you like me to create the second notebook for activation patching as well, or would you 
  prefer to review and test this one first? 
 
> Great! I'll review and test the first notebook. While I do that, please make any necessary updates  
  to your plan file to ensure it matches the implementation. 
 
⏺ I'll update the plan file to match the implementation.

     573  
     574  2. **Code Organization**: 
     575     - Each notebook is self-contained with clear sections 
     576     - Helper functions are defined as needed within the notebook 
     574  # Fit model 
     575  model = LinearRegression() 
     576  model.fit(X, y) 
     577  
     578  3. **Compatibility with Different Models**: 
     579     - The code handles different head types (regression, classification, token) 
     580     - The notebooks work regardless of how the model was frozen during training 
     581     - TransformerLens hooks work with all model architectures 
     578  # Calculate R² score 
     579  r2 = model.score(X, y) 
     580  slope = model.coef_[0] 
     581  intercept = model.intercept_ 
     582  
     583  4. **Extensibility**: 
     584     - Additional analyses can be added as new cells  
     585     - The notebooks serve as starting points for more complex experiments 
     583  # Plot the data with regression line

     644  
     645  After implementing these notebooks, you can: 
 
⏺ I've updated the plan file to match the implemented notebook. The updated plan now includes: 
 
  1. More Robust Implementation Details: 
    - Better error handling for weight extraction 
    - Enhanced visualization with proper annotations and metrics 
    - Updated function signatures to match actual implementation 
  2. Additional Statistical Analysis: 
    - Random baseline comparisons for measuring significance

> Hmm, running this code on gpt2: 
  ``` 
  # Extract MLP weights for the target neuron 
  try: 
      mlp_in_weights = get_mlp_in_weights(base_model, target_layer, target_neuron) 
      print(f"MLP input weights shape: {mlp_in_weights.shape}") 
       
      mlp_out_weights = get_mlp_out_weights(base_model, target_layer, target_neuron)

         device='mps:0', requires_grad=True) 
  ``` 
 
  What would you suggest I do? Don't change code, please, just tell me what you think should happen. 
 
✻ Thinking… 
 
  It looks like there's an issue with how the MLP weights are accessed in the TransformerLens model.  
  The error suggests that mlp_in_weights is a Parameter object directly rather than something with a  
  weight attribute. 
 
  Based on the tensor you showed, it seems that model.blocks[layer].mlp.W_in is already the weight  
  tensor itself (a Parameter), not a module with a weight attribute. This is a common pattern in some 
   PyTorch implementations where weights are stored directly as Parameters. 
 
  So rather than trying to access: 
  mlp_in = model.blocks[layer].mlp.W_in.weight 
 
  We should access the Parameter directly: 
  mlp_in = model.blocks[layer].mlp.W_in 
 
  And similarly for the output weights, instead of: 
  mlp_out = model.blocks[layer].mlp.W_out.weight 
 
  We should use: 
  mlp_out = model.blocks[layer].mlp.W_out 
 
  Since we've already seen in your error message and tensor printout that these are directly  
  Parameter objects with the tensor data, not modules with weight attributes. 
 
  The fix would involve modifying the get_mlp_in_weights and get_mlp_out_weights functions to account 
   for both styles of storing weights: 
  1. As direct Parameters (model.blocks[layer].mlp.W_in) 
  2. As attributes of modules (model.blocks[layer].mlp.c_fc.weight) 
 
  Without changing the code, I would suggest you manually extract the weights when running the  
  notebook: 
 
  # For input weights 
  mlp_in_weights = base_model.blocks[target_layer].mlp.W_in[target_neuron] 
  print(f"MLP input weights shape: {mlp_in_weights.shape}") 
 
  # For output weights 
  mlp_out_weights = base_model.blocks[target_layer].mlp.W_out[:, target_neuron] 
  print(f"MLP output weights shape: {mlp_out_weights.shape}") 
 
  This should give you the direct weights without going through the helper functions that are causing 
   the error. 
 
⏺ I see the issue. In TransformerLens, the MLP weights are stored directly as Parameter objects, not 
  as attributes of modules. So when the code tries to access .weight on a Parameter, it fails. 
 
  Instead of using the helper functions, you could directly access the weights like this: 
 
  # For input weights - direct access 
  mlp_in_weights = base_model.blocks[target_layer].mlp.W_in[target_neuron] 
 
  # For output weights - direct access 
  mlp_out_weights = base_model.blocks[target_layer].mlp.W_out[:, target_neuron] 
 
  The key difference is that in TransformerLens, W_in and W_out are already the weight tensors 
  themselves, not modules with a .weight attribute. 
 
> Yep, that worked! 
 
  Here's a different issue. In comparing the learned prediction activations to the MLP in and out  
  activations, we need to make sure we're comparing tensors of the same size. Is that right? 
 
  But what we're fetching (mlp.W_in and mlp.W_out) is of d_mlp (ie 4 * d_model) instead of d_model.  
  What we want to compare to is what's being pulled out of the residual stream (on the in side) and  
  what's being put back in the residual stream (on the out side). So I think we need to fetch  
  different tensors. What do you think? Again, please don't change code, just give me your opinion. 
 
✻ Thinking… 
 
  You're absolutely right, and this is an important point I missed. Let's think about the dimensions  
  and what we're comparing: 
 
  1. The head's linear weights are predicting from the residual stream (d_model) to a scalar 
  2. The MLP has the following components: 
    - Input weights (W_in): mapping from residual stream (d_model) to activation space (d_mlp) 
    - Output weights (W_out): mapping from activation space (d_mlp) to residual stream (d_model) 
 
  I was incorrectly suggesting to compare: 
  - mlp.W_in[target_neuron] - This is a (d_model,) tensor that maps from residual stream to a single  
  neuron 
  - mlp.W_out[:, target_neuron] - This is a (d_model,) tensor that maps from a single neuron back to  
  residual stream 
 
  But you're right that these have the wrong shape for what we're trying to do.  
 
  For the linear prediction, we're using a head that maps from residual stream (d_model) to a scalar  
  activation value. This looks like: 
  - linear_weights: (d_model,) 
 
  What we want to compare to is: 
  1. How the neuron reads from the residual stream: which is correctly mlp.W_in[target_neuron]  
  (d_model,) 
  2. How the neuron writes to the residual stream: which should be mlp.W_out[:, target_neuron]  
  (d_model,) 
 
  So actually I think our comparison was correct! The shapes are: 
  - linear_weights: (d_model,) - How the head predicts the neuron activity 
  - mlp.W_in[target_neuron]: (d_model,) - How the neuron reads from residual stream 
  - mlp.W_out[:, target_neuron]: (d_model,) - How the neuron writes to residual stream 
 
  These should all be tensors of shape (d_model,) and the comparison makes sense as-is. 
 
  Let me double-check my reasoning... 
 
  Wait, I think I may have misunderstood your question. Are you saying that W_in and W_out are the  
  wrong tensors to compare to because they map to/from the d_mlp space rather than directly comparing 
   the residual stream connections? 
 
  If so, I think you're confusing the weight shapes. Let me clarify: 
 
  - W_in has shape (d_mlp, d_model) - each row is a different MLP neuron 
  - W_in[target_neuron] has shape (d_model,) - just the weights for our target neuron 
  - W_out has shape (d_model, d_mlp) - columns are different MLP neurons 
  - W_out[:, target_neuron] has shape (d_model,) - just how this neuron projects back 
 
  So we should be comparing: 
  - linear_weights: (d_model,)  
  - W_in[target_neuron]: (d_model,) 
  - W_out[:, target_neuron]: (d_model,) 
 
  These all measure how a particular direction in the d_model space relates to the neuron. 
 
⏺ You're raising an important point about the dimensions, but I think the current approach is 
  actually correct. 
 
  Let me clarify the shapes: 
 
  1. The linear weights from our prediction head: shape (d_model,) - This is a vector mapping from 
  residual stream to the neuron's activation 
  2. For MLP in weights: 
    - mlp.W_in has shape (d_mlp, d_model) where each row corresponds to a different neuron 
    - mlp.W_in[target_neuron] has shape (d_model,) - This is exactly what we want: how this specific 
  neuron reads from the residual stream 
  3. For MLP out weights: 
    - mlp.W_out has shape (d_model, d_mlp) where each column corresponds to a different neuron 
    - mlp.W_out[:, target_neuron] has shape (d_model,) - This is exactly how this neuron's activity 
  gets projected back to the residual stream 
 
  All three should be vectors of dimension (d_model,) and the comparison makes sense because they all 
   describe mappings between the residual stream and our target neuron. 
 
> Oh right, you're totally right. But in the cell starting with '# Extract MLP weights for the target 
   neuron', what gets printed (just showing the input part, but it's the same for output) is  
  ``` 
  TransformerLens standard format 
  Returning info for the target neuron: 481 
  MLP input weights shape: torch.Size([3072]) 
  ``` 
 
  (note that d_model is 768) 
 
  The extra line printed ('Returning info...') is a print statement I added to confirm that we're in  
  the 'neuron is not None' branch, so we should be returning `mlp_in[neuron]`. 
 
⏺ I see the issue - it looks like your TransformerLens model might be organizing the MLP weights 
  differently than expected. 
 
  If the MLP input weights shape is showing as [3072] for a single neuron (which is 4*768), then it 
  suggests we're getting the entire row of the neuron's weights, but in a flattened format. This 
  could happen if the MLP is structured differently in your specific model version. 
 
  Since the shapes don't match (3072 vs 768), the cosine similarity calculation will still work 
  mathematically, but the comparison won't be meaningful because we're not comparing corresponding 
  dimensions. 
 
  For a more accurate comparison, you would want to use weights that match the dimensionality of your 
   prediction head's weights. You might need to either: 
 
  1. Reshape the returned weights to match the expected format, or 
  2. Directly access different components of the model that correspond to the residual stream 
  connections 
 
  If you want to debug further, I'd recommend printing the actual shapes of the tensors at different 
  stages to understand what's happening. 
 
> Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Is it possible that we're reversing the row/column use? For input we  
  use `return mlp_in[neuron]` and for output we use `return mlp_out[:, neuron]`. The shapes of mlp_in 
   and mlp_out are torch.Size([768, 3072]) and torch.Size([3072, 768]) respectively. 
 
⏺ You're absolutely right! I misunderstood the indexing issue. Let's clarify this: 
 
  For GPT-2, the weight shapes are: 
  - MLP input weights (W_in): torch.Size([d_mlp, d_model]) = [3072, 768] 
  - MLP output weights (W_out): torch.Size([d_model, d_mlp]) = [768, 3072] 
 
  When we do: 
  1. mlp_in[neuron] - we're asking for the neuron-th row from a [3072, 768] matrix 
    - This gives us a [768] vector, which is correct for comparing with the residual stream input 
  2. mlp_out[:, neuron] - we're asking for the neuron-th column from a [768, 3072] matrix 
    - This also gives us a [768] vector, correct for the residual stream output 
 
  But it looks like your get_mlp_in_weights might have the dimensions reversed if it's returning a 
  [3072] vector. The input weights for a single neuron should be a vector of size [d_model] = [768], 
  not [d_mlp] = [3072]. 
 
  Let's confirm the shapes: 
  print(f"MLP input matrix shape: {base_model.blocks[target_layer].mlp.W_in.shape}") 
  print(f"MLP output matrix shape: {base_model.blocks[target_layer].mlp.W_out.shape}") 
 
  I think we need to flip the indexing in one of the functions. If W_in is [3072, 768], then 
  W_in[neuron] gives a [768] vector as needed. 
 
> No, sorry, maybe I didn't say that clearly. What you're saying seems backwards. 
  W_in (as actually printed by the current code) is torch.Size([768, 3072]) 
  W_out is torch.Size([3072, 768]) 
 
⏺ Ah, I apologize for the confusion. You're right - I had the dimensions backwards. 
 
  Let's clarify the correct indexing based on the actual shapes: 
 
  - MLP input weights (W_in): torch.Size([768, 3072]) 
    - This means we have 768 inputs (residual stream) mapping to 3072 hidden neurons 
    - To get a specific neuron's input weights, we need W_in[:, neuron] 
    - This gives us a [768] vector representing how this neuron reads from the residual stream 
  - MLP output weights (W_out): torch.Size([3072, 768]) 
    - This means we have 3072 hidden neurons mapping to 768 outputs (residual stream) 
    - To get a specific neuron's output weights, we need W_out[neuron, :] 
    - This gives us a [768] vector representing how this neuron writes to the residual stream 
 
  So the issue is that your functions have the indexing flipped: 
 
  - For input weights: Instead of mlp_in[neuron], it should be mlp_in[:, neuron] 
  - For output weights: Instead of mlp_out[:, neuron], it should be mlp_out[neuron, :] 
 
  That would explain why you're getting a [3072] vector instead of a [768] vector - you're getting a 
  row when you need a column (or vice versa). 
 
> Hmm. I've been running and thinking about the first notebook, linear_weights_analysis.ipynb. I want 
   to sanity check something. Please think hard about the approach we've taken to try to understand  
  whether the predictor we've trained (the regression head or the model itself) has learned to  
  directly use the information from the neuron in question. Are we going about it the right way?  
  Should we expect the code in the notebook to tell us? Why or why not? 
 
✻ Thinking… 
 
  This is a great question that gets at the core of what we're trying to accomplish with the linear  
  weights analysis notebook. Let me think carefully about the approach: 
 
  Our central question: Has the trained predictor learned to directly use information from the target 
   neuron? 
 
  What we're doing in the notebook: 
  1. We extract the linear weights from the trained predictor head 
  2. We extract MLP input weights for the neuron (how the neuron reads from the residual stream) 
  3. We extract MLP output weights for the neuron (how the neuron writes to the residual stream) 
  4. We compare these weights using cosine similarity 
 
  Let's think about what these comparisons tell us: 
 
  1. Similarity with MLP Input Weights (predictor weights vs. how the neuron reads from residual  
  stream): 
    - A high similarity would suggest the predictor is looking at the same patterns in the residual  
  stream that the neuron itself looks at 
    - This would suggest the predictor has learned to "mimic" how the neuron reads information 
  2. Similarity with MLP Output Weights (predictor weights vs. how the neuron writes to residual  
  stream): 
    - A high similarity would suggest the predictor is sensitive to how the neuron's activations  
  affect the residual stream 
    - This would suggest the predictor has learned to track the neuron's influence on later layers 
 
  But there are some important limitations and subtleties to this approach: 
 
  1. The predictor might not be linear: If the predictor uses a non-linear hidden layer, the  
  comparison with just the linear output weights isn't capturing the full predictive capability. 
  2. Direction of information flow: The predictor is making predictions based on the residual stream, 
   which happens before the neuron's activation is fully determined. There's a temporal aspect we  
  need to be careful about. 
  3. Confounding factors: Both weights could be similar because they're both shaped by some third  
  factor in the data or model. 
  4. Dimensional mismatch: If we're not extracting the right-shaped weights, the comparisons won't be 
   valid. 
  5. The predictor might use indirect information: The predictor might be picking up on patterns that 
   correlate with the neuron's activation but aren't directly what the neuron looks for or outputs. 
 
  A better approach might be to use the patching notebook as the primary tool here. By directly  
  modifying the neuron's activation and observing how it affects the prediction, we can establish a  
  more causal relationship. If patching the neuron significantly changes the prediction in a way that 
   tracks the magnitude of the patch, that's stronger evidence that the predictor is directly using  
  that neuron's information. 
 
  In fact, the two notebooks together give us complementary information: 
  - The weights analysis tells us if the predictor is looking at similar patterns as the neuron 
  - The patching analysis tells us if changing the neuron's activation directly influences the  
  prediction 
 
  So to answer the question: The current approach provides useful information but is not sufficient  
  by itself. We should expect the weights analysis to give us correlational information, but the  
  patching notebook will provide more causal evidence about whether the predictor is using the neuron 
   directly. 
 
⏺ You're raising a fundamental question about our methodology. Let me think carefully about this: 
 
  The approach in this notebook is based on analyzing weight similarities, which has some important 
  limitations: 
 
  1. Correlation vs. Causation: Weight similarities only tell us if the predictor is looking for 
  similar patterns as the neuron, not whether it's actually using the neuron's output directly. 
  2. Weight Dimensionality: The dimension issues you identified are critical. If we're not comparing 
  the right projection directions, our conclusions could be misleading. 
  3. Confounding Variables: Both weights could be similar because they're detecting the same 
  underlying patterns in the data, not because one depends on the other. 
  4. Indirect Relationships: The predictor might be using information that correlates with the 
  neuron's activity but isn't actually the neuron itself. 
 
  The patching approach in the second notebook is actually much more direct for answering your 
  question. By intervening on the neuron's activation and measuring how the prediction changes, we 
  get causal evidence about whether the predictor is using information from that specific neuron. 
 
  A more reliable approach would be: 
  1. Use the weights analysis for initial hypotheses about relationships 
  2. Confirm with activation patching to establish causal influence 
  3. Examine relationships across multiple neurons to rule out coincidental correlations 
 
  So while the weight analysis provides useful insights, the patching approach would give you a much 
  stronger answer to whether the predictor is directly using the neuron's information. 
 
> I think the weight dimensionality is fine, I've fixed that. 
 
  The other three points seem essentially the same? 
 
  I agree that the second notebook will provide important confirmation. 
 
  Except...interestingly there seems to be no meaningful cosine similarity between the linear  
  predictor and either the input or output weights of the neuron (the similarities are 0.0264 and  
  -0.0424). 
 
  Think very hard and carefully about this in a systematic way. Do you think this is a valid result  
  suggesting that the predictor learns an entirely separate model of the relationship between input  
  and neuron activation, or have we made a mistake in our reasoning or our code somewhere? 
 
✻ Thinking… 
 
  Let me think step by step about this very carefully: 
 
  1. What we're measuring: 
    - Cosine similarity between the linear predictor weights and the MLP input weights for the neuron 
    - Cosine similarity between the linear predictor weights and the MLP output weights for the  
  neuron 
  2. The small values we're seeing (0.0264 and -0.0424): 
    - These are very close to zero, indicating almost no correlation between the directions 
    - This suggests the predictor is using a completely different set of features than either the  
  input or output path of the neuron 
  3. Possible interpretations: 
 
  3. a) Valid result - The predictor has found a completely different way to predict the neuron's  
  activation: 
    - It might be looking at other patterns in the residual stream that correlate with this neuron's  
  activation 
    - It could be detecting higher-level semantic features that predict when this neuron will  
  activate 
    - It might have found a shortcut that works for the training data but doesn't capture the true  
  causal mechanism 
 
  b) Methodological issue - Our comparison isn't capturing the true relationship: 
    - The neuron might be performing a non-linear transformation that isn't captured by simple weight 
   similarity 
    - The neuron's activity might depend on multiple vectors in combination, not just one direction 
    - We might need to look at multiple layers or the broader context in which the neuron operates 
 
  c) Technical error - Something is wrong in how we're extracting or comparing the weights: 
    - Are we definitely using the correct neuron index? 
    - Are the weights properly normalized before computing the similarity? 
    - Is there any preprocessing or transformation happening in the model that we're missing? 
    - Are we working with the right tensor shapes? 
  4. Sanity checks we should perform: 
 
  4. a) Check that the neuron index is correct and consistent 
  b) Verify that the dimensions of all weight vectors match (which you've done) 
  c) Confirm that the weight extraction is giving sensible values (not all zeros or NaNs) 
  d) Try a few different neurons to see if this is a general pattern or specific to this neuron 
  e) Look at the activation patterns of the neuron to understand what it might be detecting 
  f) Check that the predictor actually works (has decent accuracy in predicting the neuron's  
  activation) 
  5. Expected relationship if working correctly: 
 
  If the predictor is learning to model the neuron's actual function, we would expect: 
  - Some meaningful similarity to the input weights (if it's learning what patterns the neuron  
  detects) 
  - Or some meaningful similarity to the output weights (if it's learning how the neuron's activation 
   impacts the model) 
  - Low similarity could be valid if the neuron's function is highly non-linear or context-dependent 
 
  6. Is the lack of correlation actually reasonable? 
 
  It could be reasonable if: 
  - The neuron's activity is determined by complex interactions not captured by a single vector 
  - The predictor is finding a completely different set of features that correlate with activation 
  - The neuron has a highly distributed representation that's difficult to capture with linear  
  methods 
 
  Given how transformers work with distributed representations, it's not entirely surprising that a  
  linear predictor might find a different basis for predicting a neuron's activation than the actual  
  path the computation takes in the network. 
 
  Let's think about ways to validate: 
 
  1. The most direct way would be the patching experiments in notebook 2. If patching the neuron's  
  activation causes proportional changes in the prediction, that would provide strong evidence that  
  the predictor is actually tracking this neuron. 
  2. We could also examine whether the predictor is actually accurate at predicting the neuron's  
  activation. If it has high accuracy despite low weight similarity, that would confirm it's found a  
  different but effective approach. 
  3. We could try visualizing both the predictor weights and the neuron weights to see what patterns  
  they're picking up on. 
 
  So, I think the low similarity scores could be a valid finding that suggests the predictor is  
  learning an alternative model of what predicts this neuron's activation, rather than directly  
  mimicking the computation path. However, without the patching experiments and additional  
  validation, we can't completely rule out methodological or technical issues. 
 
⏺ Looking at these near-zero cosine similarities (0.0264 and -0.0424) very systematically: 
 
  This result is intriguing but potentially valid. Here's my analysis: 
 
  Possibilities to consider: 
 
  1. Different feature basis: The predictor could be using an entirely different set of features that 
   correlate with the neuron activation, but don't align with the original computation path. This is 
  mathematically possible - there can be multiple orthogonal directions in high-dimensional space 
  that correlate with a target. 
  2. Non-linearity: The neuron's actual function involves non-linear transformations that aren't 
  captured by comparing linear weights. The predictor may have learned a linear approximation that 
  works but uses different features. 
  3. Network context: The neuron may operate as part of a larger circuit where its activation depends 
   on interactions with other neurons that our predictor is capturing indirectly. 
  4. Implementation issue: Less likely given your fixes, but could be related to how weights are 
  normalized or indexed. 
 
  How to validate: 
 
  1. Check prediction accuracy: If your predictor has good accuracy despite dissimilar weights, that 
  confirms it found an alternative but effective approach. 
  2. Compare with random baselines: Calculate how similar random vectors would be to confirm these 
  similarities aren't just noise. 
  3. Run the patching experiments: This will directly confirm whether the predictor is causally 
  tracking this neuron. 
 
  I lean toward this being a valid result suggesting the predictor has learned an alternative 
  representation. This is actually common in mechanistic interpretability - there are often multiple 
  ways to extract the same information from a high-dimensional representation.

> OK! Let's go ahead and write the second notebook with the activation patching, based on the written 
   plan (with consideration of whether the plan seems valid). 
 
⏺ I'll create the activation patching notebook based on our plan. Let me start by implementing it: 
 
⏺ Write(file_path: mech_interp/notebooks/activation_patching.ipynb)… 
  ⎿ Wrote 898 lines to mech_interp/notebooks/activation_patching.ipynb 
     { 
      "cells": [ 
       { 
        "cell_type": "markdown", 
        "metadata": {}, 
        "source": [ 
         "# Neuron Activation Patching\n", 
         "\n", 
         "This notebook explores the causal relationship between a neuron's activation and the  
     model's prediction for that activation. By patching (modifying) the neuron's activation and  
     observing changes in the prediction, we can determine whether the prediction model is directly  
     using information from this neuron.\n", 
         "\n", 
     … +888 lines (ctrl+r to expand) 
 
⏺ I've created the second notebook for activation patching. While implementing it, I made several 
  improvements to the original plan: 
 
  1. Enhanced Patching Hook Logic: 
    - Added position-aware patching to precisely target the last token 
    - Used a HookContext class to pass position information to hooks 
    - Improved validation with intermediate verification steps 
  2. Expanded Analysis: 
    - Added per-input sensitivity analysis to see which inputs are most affected 
    - Included visualizations that show the relationship in activation-prediction space 
    - Added statistical summaries with regression analysis 
  3. More Robust Visualization: 
    - Included multi-panel plots to show different perspectives on the data 
    - Added text labels to points to make interpretation easier 
    - Enhanced regression plot with equation and statistical information 
  4. Better Interpretation: 
    - Added a comprehensive interpretation section explaining what different results mean 
    - Explained how to interpret different values of slope and R² 
    - Connected the patching results back to the weight analysis findings 
 
  The notebook is designed to provide causal evidence about whether the predictor is directly using 
  information from the target neuron, complementing the correlational approach from the weight 
  analysis notebook. 
 
  Both notebooks together should give you a more complete picture of how your trained prediction 
  model relates to the actual neuron computations in the network. 
 
> OK, great, do you need to update the plan to take the changes into account (in case we need to  
  recreate them later)?

  The activation patching notebook now includes a detailed interpretation section that helps 
  understand the results in context. 
 
  Is there anything else you'd like me to improve or clarify in either notebook? 
 
> Yes, actually, before I try running the new notebook, I'd like to go back to thinking about the old 
   one for a minute. I just want to discuss, don't make any immediate code changes. Recall that we're 
   using a simple linear regression head with no hidden layer. 
 
  The question I'm trying to ask with this mech interp work is: does the info that the regression  
  head is pulling from the residual stream match the info that the target neuron is putting into the  
  residual stream. 
 
  Is looking at the output weights of the linear regreassion head actually the right way to look at  
  the info that the regression head is pulling from the residual stream? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
✻ Thinking… 
 
  Let me think carefully about your question. You're asking a fundamental conceptual question about  
  interpreting the weights in a linear regression head. 
 
  For a simple linear regression head with no hidden layer, the architecture is just a linear  
  projection from the residual stream directly to the output (the predicted activation). So let's  
  clarify the dimensions: 
 
  1. Residual stream dimension: d_model (e.g., 768 for GPT-2) 
  2. Output dimension: 1 (a scalar prediction of the neuron's activation) 
 
  The weights in this linear head form a vector of shape (d_model,), where each weight tells us how  
  much that dimension of the residual stream contributes to the predicted activation. 
 
  Now, let's think about the target neuron's information flow: 
  1. Neuron input weights: A vector of shape (d_model,) that determines how the neuron reads from the 
   residual stream 
  2. Neuron output weights: A vector of shape (d_model,) that determines how the neuron's activation  
  affects the residual stream 
 
  The core question is: "Does the info that the regression head is pulling from the residual stream  
  match the info that the target neuron is putting into the residual stream?" 
 
  In mathematical terms, we're asking if the regression head's weights align with either the neuron's 
   input or output weights. If they align with: 
 
  - The neuron's input weights: It means the regression head is picking up on the same patterns that  
  trigger the neuron 
  - The neuron's output weights: It means the regression head is detecting the neuron's "signature"  
  in the residual stream 
 
  For a linear regression head, the weights indeed represent exactly what information it's "pulling"  
  from the residual stream. Each weight corresponds to how much that dimension contributes to the  
  prediction. 
 
  So yes, comparing the regression head's weights to the neuron's input and output weights is exactly 
   the right approach to answer your question. The cosine similarity tells us how aligned these  
  vectors are in high-dimensional space. 
 
⏺ You're asking a great question about the conceptual interpretation of our weight comparisons. 
 
  For a simple linear regression head without hidden layers, the weights directly represent what 
  information it's extracting from the residual stream. Let me break this down: 
 
  In the linear head, each weight value describes how much that specific dimension of the residual 
  stream contributes to the prediction. So the weight vector (of size d_model) is essentially saying 
  "pay attention to these dimensions in these proportions to predict the neuron activation." 
 
  When we compare this with: 
 
  1. The neuron's input weights: We're asking "Is the head looking at the same dimensions that 
  activate the neuron?" If similar, the head has learned to look at the same upstream patterns that 
  trigger the neuron. 
  2. The neuron's output weights: We're asking "Is the head looking at the imprint the neuron leaves 
  on the residual stream?" If similar, the head has learned to detect the neuron's direct 
  contribution to downstream computation. 
 
  Since you're using a simple linear head, the weight vector is indeed the right thing to examine - 
  it directly encodes the linear transformation from residual stream to predicted activation. 
 
  The near-zero cosine similarities you found are therefore meaningful and suggest that your 
  predictor is indeed learning a completely different basis for predicting the neuron's behavior than 
   either its inputs or outputs. 
 
> That makes sense, with one additional question. You're talking about the relative importance of  
  different dimensions. The linear representation hypothesis that we can think of LLM features as  
  being represented by *directions* in the latent space. Do you think that our approach correctly  
  compares those directions? 
 
✻ Thinking… 
 
  This is a very insightful question about comparing directions in latent space. Let me think about  
  whether our approach correctly compares these directions. 
 
  The linear representation hypothesis suggests that features in LLMs are represented as directions  
  in the latent space. In this framework: 
 
  1. What we're doing: Computing cosine similarity between weight vectors. 
    - Cosine similarity is orientation/direction-sensitive rather than magnitude-sensitive.  
    - It measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, which is appropriate for comparing  
  directions. 
    - A value of 1 means perfect alignment, 0 means orthogonal, and -1 means opposite directions. 
  2. Are these the right directions to compare? 
    - For the linear head's weights: Yes, this vector defines the direction in residual space that  
  the head is attending to. 
    - For MLP input weights: Yes, this vector is the direction in residual space that activates this  
  neuron. 
    - For MLP output weights: Yes, this vector is the direction that the neuron imprints on the  
  residual stream. 
  3. Is the normalization correct? 
    - Cosine similarity inherently normalizes for magnitude, so we're only comparing directions. 
    - We're also correctly normalizing the vectors before computing similarity to ensure we're only  
  comparing directions. 
  4. What about non-linearities? 
    - Our approach assumes linearity at the comparison stage. We're comparing linear projections. 
    - The MLP has non-linearities between the input and output weights, which is why we consider them 
   separately. 
    - The regression head is linear, so there's no issue there. 
 
  So yes, our approach is correctly comparing directions in latent space, which is appropriate for  
  testing the linear representation hypothesis. The low similarities suggest that the predictor has  
  found an entirely different direction in latent space that correlates with neuron activation but  
  isn't directly related to the neuron's input or output projections. 
 
⏺ Yes, our approach does correctly compare directions in the latent space, which is the key concept 
  in the linear representation hypothesis. 
 
  The cosine similarity measurement we're using is specifically designed to compare directions rather 
   than magnitudes. When we compute cosine similarity between two vectors, we're measuring: 
 
  1. The alignment of the directions (angle between vectors) 
  2. Independent of their magnitudes 
 
  Our normalization step: 
  a_norm = torch.nn.functional.normalize(a_flat.unsqueeze(0)).squeeze(0) 
  b_norm = torch.nn.functional.normalize(b_flat.unsqueeze(0)).squeeze(0) 
 
  Ensures we're comparing unit vectors (pure directions) rather than being influenced by vector 
  magnitudes. 
 
  Since we're comparing: 
  - Linear head weights → direction in residual space the head attends to 
  - MLP input weights → direction that activates the neuron 
  - MLP output weights → direction the neuron imprints on residual space 
 
  Our approach is testing exactly what we want: whether the regression head is paying attention to 
  the same direction in latent space as either the neuron's input or output directions. 
 
  The near-zero similarities strongly suggest that the predictor has found a different direction in 
  latent space that correlates with neuron activation but is orthogonal to the neuron's own 
  computation directions. 
 
> OK, great! 
 
  Now a maybe-trickier question: in the case where we unfreeze parts of the model, we also freeze the 
   linear regression head so that it's just a random direction. This is so we can directly  
  investigate what the *model* learns, without also taking into account the contribution from an  
  extra trained layer. 
 
  For investigating whether the model has learned to look at the direction that activates the target  
  neuron, and the direction the neuron puts in the residual stream, what should we be looking at in  
  that case? 
 
⏺ That's an insightful question about the unfrozen model case with a frozen (random) head. 
 
  In this scenario, since the linear head weights remain fixed at their random initialization, they 
  define a fixed, arbitrary direction in the residual space. What's happening during training is that 
   the model is adapting its internal representations to make the final residual stream activate that 
   fixed direction in proportion to the target neuron's activation. 
 
  To investigate what the model has learned in this case: 
 
  1. Primary Analysis: Look at how the model's activations have changed pre vs. post training 
    - Compare the final residual stream representation (just before the frozen head) for the same 
  inputs, before and after training 
    - Calculate the difference vector (post-training minus pre-training) for these representations 
    - This difference vector shows the "adaptation direction" - how the model adjusted its 
  representations 
  2. Key Comparisons: 
    - Compare this adaptation direction with the neuron's input weights - this would tell you if the 
  model learned to mimic the neuron's input pattern 
    - Compare it with the neuron's output weights - this would tell you if the model learned to 
  directly expose the neuron's output 
  3. Alternative Approach: Principal Component Analysis 
    - Run PCA on the differences in residual stream activations before and after training 
    - The top principal component represents the main direction the model has learned to modify 
    - Compare this principal component with neuron input/output directions 
  4. Causal Testing: This is where the patching approach becomes especially valuable 
    - By directly intervening on the neuron and seeing how the model's final representation changes, 
  you're getting causal evidence about the relationship 
 
  The patching experiments are particularly important in this case since the weight analysis becomes 
  more indirect when the model itself is adapting rather than just the head. 
 
> Got it. I don't totally love either of those. 
 
  Could we do something like: check the final state of the residual stream to see whether the model  
  has learned to put something there that, after being run through the fixed linear head, represents  
  the target neuron's input or output direction? 
 
⏺ Yes, that's a more direct approach that I think gets right to the heart of what you're trying to 
  understand. Let me refine this idea: 
 
  Approach: Residual Stream Direction Analysis 
 
  1. Extract the Fixed Direction: Since the linear head is frozen with random weights (let's call 
  this vector w₀), it defines a fixed direction in the residual space. 
  2. For each input example: 
    - Run the model before training and extract the final residual stream representation (r_pre) 
    - Run the model after training and extract the final residual stream representation (r_post) 
    - Calculate the difference (r_diff = r_post - r_pre) 
  3. Project the Difference: Project r_diff onto w₀ 
    - This tells you how much the model has shifted its representation along the direction that the 
  frozen head is measuring 
    - proj = (r_diff · w₀) / ||w₀|| 
  4. Look for Structure in the Projection: 
    - If the model has learned to align the neuron's input pattern with the fixed head direction: 
        - The projected difference should correlate with neuron input weights 
    - If the model has learned to align the neuron's output with the fixed head direction: 
        - The projected difference should correlate with neuron output weights 
  5. Visualize: Plot these projections against the neuron's activation to see the relationship 
 
  This approach directly captures what you're asking: has the model modified its representations to 
  align something relevant (input pattern or output impact) with the fixed head direction? 
 
  This could be implemented as a targeted analysis in a third notebook if you want to specifically 
  focus on the unfrozen model case.
